<h2>THE PRICE OF SUPPORT.</h2>

<center><i>A Fragment of a coming Contemporary Romance.</i></center>

<blockquote><p>"Is it possible that Mr. <span class="smcap">Gladstone</span>, not content with having allied
himself with the Parnellites, or with having endeavoured to sow
jealousies between the component parts of the United Kingdom, is at
last endeavouring to purchase the parliamentary support of the
South-Eastern Railway? The idea seems almost too humiliating to be
entertained; but it is not easy to place any other interpretation
upon this new and startling announcement. Can it be conceived that
the safety of England ranks as nothing in his estimation when it is
brought into competition with the possibility of winning a few votes
from the interested supporters of a commercial
enterprise?"&mdash;<i>Times.</i></p></blockquote>

<center>VOL. I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Compact.</span></center>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was on a sultry August evening in the memorable year 1887 that a
stranger, whose anxious gaze, now and again fixed on the entrance,
denoted the fact that he was awaiting the arrival of one of the Members,
crossed and re-crossed the pavement of the Hall of the Reform Club with
a step that indicated a high condition of nervous trepidation. To the
casual observer he might have passed for a solicitor in an extreme state
of irritability. The Hall-Porter, however, who had watched him narrowly,
had recognised him for who he was. He knew that the restless interloper,
who had several times peered into his carpet-bag, and examined specimens
of Channel chalk, and had, when he thought no one was looking, hacked a
London, Chatham and Dover trains'-bill with his penknife, was no other
than the famous Sir <span class="smcap">Edward Watkin</span>, the then Chairman of the
South-Eastern Railway Company. He approached him.</p>

<p>"He won't be long," he said, intuitively guessing the object of his
visit, and addressing him kindly. "Ha! hark! Here he comes!" He had
scarcely spoken, when a roaring cheer, borne on the sweet evening air,
broke the comparative silence of the street outside, and in another
minute a surging and struggling mob, who were shouting themselves
hoarse, had deposited safely from their shoulders, on the door-step of
the Club, their great hero and idol, whom they had thus, as was their
wont, nightly carried in triumph from the House.</p>

<p>The ex-Premier, for indeed the buoyant bearing, the high shirt-collar,
and the contagious enthusiasm of the new arrival proclaimed his identity
at once, dashed up the steps three at a time, and, waving a radiant
farewell of thanks to the crowd, bounded into the Hall, where, seeing
the stranger, he instantly seized him by the arm, and hurriedly led him
to a recess.</p>

<p>"This is very good and genial of you, my dear Sir <span class="smcap">Edward</span>," he commenced.</p>

<p>The other eyed him cautiously. "You wanted to see me?" he rejoined,
sulkily.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed!" was the brisk reply. "I wished to tell you that, as you
had been wicked enough,&mdash;ha! ha!&mdash;to conceive the idea of uniting
England and France by a Tunnel, I had been wicked enough also to
determine to help you to do it. Ha! ha!" He laughed long and loud. His
interlocutor stared at him for a few moments aghast. Then he clutched
him.</p>

<p>"You mean this?" he asked, growing pale with excitement as he spoke.
"You mean that you will vote for the Bill?"</p>

<p>"Not only vote for the Bill, but make it a Government measure." As he
spoke he was interrupted by a commotion in Pall Mall. Some Junior
Members of the Carlton were by way of a practical joke, common enough at
this season, dropping a Unionist Liberal out of the first-floor windows
into the area, and their merriment over the exploit resounded loudly
down the street. The ex-Premier heard it and a wonderful smile played
upon his almost beautiful features. "You see, they are going to pieces
next door," he added exultingly, "I shall be in in a few weeks, nothing
can stop me; and then, I give you my word, you shall have your Tunnel."</p>

<p>The other approached him. There was a curious look in his eye. "You have
your price?" he asked. "Name it," he added under his breath, glancing
around him furtively to see they were not overheard.</p>

<p>The great Statesman winked knowingly. "Merely the South-Eastern vote,"
he whispered. "Come, is it a bargain at that?"</p>

<p>"Done!" was the quick rejoinder. They grasped hands.</p>

<p>"Show this gentleman to a four-wheeler," said the ex-Premier.</p>

<p>So they parted. But as the Grand Old Politician turned towards the
supper-room there was a fine triumphant lustre beaming in his eye, for
he knew, that if he had possibly betrayed his country, he had at least
squared the Railway Company. He had made the <i>compact</i>!</p>

<center>VOL. II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Paid in Full.</span></center>

<p>The country was about to face a great crisis in its history. Yet, as the
year 1894 opened, there were little evidences of the approaching storm.
It is true that the Gladstone Cabinet were still in power, and were
passing exasperating measures. But this was nothing new. Last year they
had abolished Compulsory Vaccination, and had passed the Country Estates
Popular Appropriation Act. They had inaugurated the first Session of the
present one by suppressing the Volunteer Movement, and cutting down the
Naval and Military votes respectively to the modest figure of &pound;2,000,000
a year; and they pointed to the Channel Tunnel, now opened about sixteen
months, for a triumphant vindication of these Imperial economies. They
argued that a country that could pour a perpetual stream of Cook's
Tourists night and day over to the Continent, had given a guarantee for
preserving International peace such as would warrant it in reducing the
expense for its defences to a pecuniary minimum; and, though they met
with some opposition from the Permanent Departments, and were hotly
criticised by an angry mob of naval and military men, who found
themselves, at a moment's notice, both thrown out of work, and deprived
of their pay, they, nevertheless, carried their point, and effected the
proposed reductions. But a thunder-clap was about to fall upon the
unsuspecting country from a blue sky, and the Channel Tunnel, which had
inspired its misguided leaders with a baseless confidence, was destined
to inflict the shock.</p>

<p>It became known in London suddenly on the morning of the Tuesday in the
Easter Recess that the approaches to the Tunnel had been suddenly seized
by a hostile French force that had landed by the night-mail disguised as
tourists, and that the key of the apparatus destined to flood it in any
case of emergency, was not forthcoming, the Chairman of the Company, who
had charge of it, having suddenly disappeared without leaving his
address. It was also further rumoured that the guns commanding the
shore-exit had been spiked by active Shareholders anxious to protect
their property from destruction at all hazards, and were useless. When,
therefore at eleven o'clock, the second edition of the morning papers
announced that a French army was pouring through the Tunnel, and
occupying the neighbouring heights, at the rate of ten thousand men an
hour, the panic became indescribable. Nor did it diminish when it was
further known that the French Ambassador, leaving a threatening
ultimatum behind him, had that afternoon taken his departure for Paris.
The country flew to arms. Sir <span class="smcap">Archibald Harrison</span> hastily collected the
available force at Aldershot, and took up his position on the Hog's
Back, and awaited the approach of the enemy with 213 men, all told, and
three guns. They took no notice of him. At twelve the following day it
was known that the Duke of <span class="smcap">Cambridge</span>, falling back on Sydenham, in
command of a handful of Volunteers and a squadron of the Household
Cavalry hurriedly got together, had capitulated in the Refreshment
Department.</p>

<p>The details of the disaster spread like wildfire. The consternation was
terrific. The <span class="smcap">Lord Mayor</span> went into hysterics, and was, by common
consent, removed to Colney Hatch, while an angry mob invaded the War
Office, and seizing any members of the Ordnance Committee they could lay
hold of, forthwith dragged them out, and lynched them in Pall Mall. That
same evening a French army, 350,000 strong, entered London in triumph.</p>

<p>A few outrages marked this occupation. The Nelson Column was thrown
down, Waterloo Bridge blown up, Piccadilly re-christened the Rue
Boulanger, and the whole of Madame <span class="smcap">Tussaud's</span> Collection seized as
National property.</p>

<p>So matters stood, but the cutting off of the food supply, thirty
shillings being charged at a West-End Club for a plate of indifferent
tinned-rabbit, soon brought matters to a crisis. The Cabinet that at the
first approach of the enemy, had instantly retired to the Island of
Lewis, came cautiously up to town and opening negotiations for peace
with the French Government, finally signed the Tottenham Court Road
treaty, and provided for the evacuation of the country by the invader.
The terms were stringent and somewhat severe. In addition to agreeing to
the cession of India, Australia, the Cape, Canada and all her
Mediterranean possessions, together with the division of her Fleet among
the Navies of Europe, England undertook to pay an indemnity in ready
money at the Bank of England of five-hundred millions sterling.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>As a cordon of French troops was keeping back the sullen crowd that
thronged the space in front of the Royal Exchange and watched the
waggons heavily laden with the bullion that was about to be transferred
to the South-Eastern Railway for transmission to France, a tall, elastic
figure wearing a high shirt-collar, pushed eagerly up the steps of the
Mansion House, and gazed reflectively at the scene that was being
enacted below. Presently some one touched it. It turned.</p>

<p>"Ha! Sir <span class="smcap">Edward</span>," was the bright recognition, "who would ever have
thought of meeting you again, and who would ever have conceived," the
cheery voice continued, "that our little compact should have ended in
this!" The speaker pointed with a significant smile to the waggons of
bullion lumbering beneath. "Well," responded the other with a suggestive
dryness, "my support got you into power at any rate!"</p>

<p>A marvellous brightness overspread the features of his interlocutor.
"Yes, it did," he replied, "and though I am quite confident that
posterity will say it was worth the price, I see," he added airily,
waving his hand in the direction of the Bank, "that at the present
moment it is apparently being <i>paid in full</i>!"</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Well, good-bye, dear Mrs. Jones. I'm afraid I've put you out by calling

<h2>SALUBRITIES ABROAD.</h2>

<p><i>Hotel Continental, Royat.</i>&mdash;Our party here (which, somehow or another,
<span class="smcap">Puller</span> has contrived to get together and introduce to each other by the
simple means of inducing M. <span class="smcap">Hall</span> to give us a room to ourselves for a
small <i>table-d'h&ocirc;te</i> at the un-Royat-like hour of 7.30) consists of La
Contessa <span class="smcap">Casanova</span>, the English wife of an Italian merchant, the head of
a large house of business in London&mdash;she is Marchesa or Contessa, I am
not certain which, but <span class="smcap">Puller</span> styles her <i>Miladi</i> and <i>Madame</i>. She is
devoted to the serious Drama, and her pet subject is <span class="smcap">Salvini</span> in
<i>Othello</i>. Her daughter, an elegant young English girl, lively, amusing,
and with a bias in favour of the very lightest forms of theatrical
entertainment.</p>

<p>Then we have Madame <span class="smcap">Metterbrun</span> and her daughters, Anglo-Germans,
thorough musicians, with <span class="smcap">Wagner</span> at their fingers' ends,&mdash;literally, as
they are accomplished pianists. There is Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dinderlin</span>, who was here
last year, and is taking the waters seriously, and who knows when to put
in the right word at the right moment. Cousin <span class="smcap">Jane</span> who is taking the
waters still more seriously and who is an excellent listener: myself an
impartial referee: and <span class="smcap">Puller</span> the Solicitor out for a holiday, who is
alternately in the highest of spirits or the lowest depths of
depression, according as the waters and weather affect him. Outside our
party there are others whom I meet occasionally, consisting of the lady
who finds fault with everything French, the gentleman who laughs at
everything French, the grumbler whom nothing satisfies, the contented
man who is pleased with everything, the man who after being here a day
is intensely bored, the man who from the moment of his arrival is always
studying Guide-books and <i>indicateurs</i> to see what is the best and
easiest way of getting away again: the patient who has come all the way
here to see the Doctor and then refuses to do anything he tells him: the
patient who has come to find out what on earth is the matter with him:
the man who doctors himself, and two or three ladies of my acquaintance
of whom I only catch occasional glimpses as they issue from Sedan-chairs
or muffled up like the Turkish women, merely recognise me with their
eyes, incline their heads and pass on their way with a little
drinking-glass in their hands.</p>

<p>To me Royat is an amusing place: it is certainly a pretty one, and its
waters in most cases are decidedly of lasting benefit. What those "most
cases" are, the patients themselves best know.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>For expanse there is nothing like the sea, and for grandeur the snow
mountains. Unless I go up to the Puy de D&ocirc;me&mdash;which I do not mean to do,
for I have been up there once, and never, never, never will go there
again&mdash;I cannot see either. And even from the top of the Puy you can
only discern the sea, or Mont Blanc, with a very good glass, on a very
clear day.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>M. <span class="smcap">Boisgobey's</span> description of a Parisian Club in his latest book (I
delight in <span class="smcap">Boisgobey</span> now that there is no <span class="smcap">Gaboriau</span>) called
<i>Grippe-Soleil</i> will amuse London Club members. The only two Clubs in
Paris I ever saw were not a bit like <span class="smcap">Boisgobey's</span> description.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>When anyone who has been under treatment a week, unexpectedly meets a
friend here, he stops short, stares at him, examines him from head to
foot, and then exclaims, in a tone of utter astonishment, "What!! <i>you</i>
here!!" as if the new arrival were either an intruder or a lunatic. The
person thus addressed immediately retorts in an injured tone, "Well,
what on earth are you here for?" and then he adds maliciously, "there
doesn't seem to be much the matter with <i>you</i>." Now to say this is to
utter your deliberate opinion that the person you are addressing is at
Royat (or any other Salubrity Abroad wherever it may be) under the false
pretence of being an invalid, and is therefore, to put it plainly, a
shammer, an impostor.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>After this greeting, explanations follow. The first man has to prove his
right to be at Royat, and the second man has to admit the evidence to be
incontestable, on the condition, implied but not expressed, of his own
case being taken as thoroughly warranting his taking the baths and
<i>traitement</i> generally at Royat.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Then comes the question of Doctors. "Who shall decide when Doctors
disagree?"&mdash;but who shall decide when patients disagree about Doctors?
"Whom do you go to?" asks the suffering <span class="smcap">Smith</span> of the invalid Brown.
"Well," says <span class="smcap">Brown</span>, apologetically,&mdash;because he is not sure, this being
his first visit, that he might not have gone to a better man, "I go to
Dr. <span class="smcap">Chose</span>," and noticing the astonishment depicted on his friend's face,
he hastens to explain, "<span class="smcap">Squills</span> sent me to him." The suffering <span class="smcap">Smith</span>
professes himself puzzled to know why on earth <span class="smcap">Squills</span> always sends his
patients to <span class="smcap">Chose</span>. "Dr. <span class="smcap">Rem's</span> the man for you, my boy," says <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. But
<span class="smcap">Brown</span> feels that he is in the toils of <span class="smcap">Squills</span>, and that it would not be
fair to him or to <span class="smcap">Chose</span>, if he suddenly left the latter and sought the
advice of Dr. <span class="smcap">Rem</span>, on the sole recommendation of <span class="smcap">Smith</span> who, after all,
is not a professional.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Then two <i>habitu&eacute;s</i> meet. "I always go to <span class="smcap">Chose</span>," says eczematic <span class="smcap">Jones</span>,
dogmatically, "first-rate fellow, <span class="smcap">Chose</span>. All the French go to him.
<i>They</i> know." "Ah!" returns gouty <span class="smcap">Robinson</span>, with conviction, "I never
have been to anyone but <span class="smcap">Rem</span>. He's the chap. All the English go to him.
Best man in Royat." And if it weren't the hour for one of them to go and
drink Eug&eacute;nie water, and for the other to take his second glass of St.
Mart, they would have a row and come to blows.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><span class="smcap">Puller</span> tells me that there's one London Doctor, describing himself as a
Gyn&aelig;cologist ("A guinea-cologist," parenthetically remarks <span class="smcap">Puller</span>), who
always sends his patients here. I think he says his name is Dr. <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>.
"He sends so many," says <span class="smcap">Puller</span>, "that I propose changing the name of
the place from Royat-les-Bains into Royat-les-Barnes." I see why he
introduced the name of <span class="smcap">Barnes</span>. Fortunately he is so delighted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span> with this
<i>jeu de mot</i>, which I fancy I've heard before, that he is off to tell
his friends in the Parc, and, as I pass a group, I overhear him
explaining the point of it to a French lady and her husband, with whom
he has a speaking acquaintance. For <span class="smcap">Puller</span> likes what he calls "airing
his French," and is not a bit shy.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The Band is performing another new tune! How is this? I can account for
it. It rained nearly all yesterday, and so the musicians didn't come
out. How did they occupy themselves? In rehearsal. Well here's one good
effect of rain at Royat, it brings out the new tunes.</p>

possibly could) was very full on the first night of <i>Loyal Love</i>, a play
which has apparently been put upon the stage for the personal and
exclusive benefit of Mrs. <span class="smcap">Brown-Potter</span>.</p>

<p>Certainly this talented lady has vastly improved since she made her
first appearance in <i>Man and Wife</i>, and has only to continue at the same
rate of progress to become in a very short time a really admirable
actress. <i>Loyal Love</i> is rather a foolish piece, and reminded me equally
of the <i>Lady of Lyons</i>, <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, and <i>Box and Cox</i>. The plot
was feeble in the extreme; and had not Mrs. <span class="smcap">Brown-Potter</span> made a decided
point by calling a rude and ancient king, who <i>would</i> wear his hat in
the presence of ladies, "Old Man," I really think the performance would
have fallen rather flat. As it was, the phrase (which was accepted by
the "first-nighters" as a colloquial "Americanism") put everyone in good
humour, and the last Act, with its amusing mock poisonings, and comical
arrests and counter-arrests, went with every token of genial
satisfaction. By the way, the "bottle trick" (by which poison is turned
into wine) should be treated more avowedly in a spirit of burlesque.
Were a decanter of pantomimic proportions introduced, the effect would
be excellent. <i>Loyal Love</i> is not a good name for this funny little&mdash;it
is only in four Acts&mdash;play. It is a pity, as the hero and heroine are
always declaring that they would like to live and die together on a
desert island, that it was not called <i>Mr. and Mrs. Robinson Crusoe</i>,
with an explanatory subtitle of the <i>Purposeless Plotter, the
Death-Dealing Wine-Cellar, and the Grand Old King</i>.</p>

<p>At the Adelphi a new and original drama called <i>The Bells of Haslemere</i>,
has been produced amidst the enthusiastic applause of the entire Press.
I am sorry to say I was a little disappointed. No doubt my expectations
had been unduly raised by the "notices." It appeared to me that there
was nothing absolutely and entirely new and original in the play, save a
series of hats worn by Mr. <span class="smcap">John Beauchamp</span> in the character of a
fraudulent trustee. However, it is only just to say that the <i>chapeaux
of Joseph Thorndyke</i> were unique. Had they been produced as "exhibits"
to an affidavit read during a summons heard before one of the Chief
Clerks in the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice, they must
have assisted materially in rendering virtue triumphant, ay, with or
without an appeal to the Judge. One of the authors of the piece, Mr.
<span class="smcap">Sydney Grundy</span>, is a well-known barrister, and no doubt the legal
training of this learned gentleman suggested their most appropriate
introduction. <i>Joseph Thorndyke</i> uncovered, might have been faithful to
his <i>cestui que</i> trust, but <i>in</i> his hat he could only have
proved&mdash;what, alas! he was&mdash;a fraudulent trustee. Mr. <span class="smcap">Terriss</span> as <i>Frank
Beresford</i>, bore a striking resemblance to the naval lieutenant in the
<i>Harbour Lights</i> whose escape from one action (on board ship) to defend
another (in a police court) roused the enthusiasm of the pit and gallery
for so many hundred nights, and Miss <span class="smcap">Millward</span> in both pieces was much
about the same individual. But in spite of this conventionality, the
play was decidedly interesting to the audience, who filled the cheaper
parts of the house. In fact I am inclined to believe that the critics
are right, and that <i>The Bells</i> will ring for any number of nights. The
scenery was admirable, and I should like to see it again. I am not quite
so sure that anything else in the drama would induce me to pay the
Adelphi a second visit. Stay, I think I should like to bestow another
glance on Mr. <span class="smcap">Beauchamp's</span> hats. I am all but certain, that from a
fraudulent-trustee-point-of-view, they are absolutely faultless,&mdash;yes,
absolutely faultless.</p>

<p>The Crystal Palace, now that the new Bill is on the fair road to become
law, seemingly has taken a fresh lease of popularity. The evening
<i>f&ecirc;tes</i> are a great feature, and jaded Londoners can scarcely do better
than to take a train from Victoria or St. Paul's, and spend a pleasant
couple of twilight hours amidst the lamps and (on Thursdays) the
fireworks. In the daytime there is always an excellent panorama, and
frequently a successful play performed by its original London company.

CHAPTER I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Blood Relations.</span></center>

<p>"<span class="smcap">It</span> is very kind of you to come round," I said, to my two friends, Sir
<span class="smcap">Harry</span> and <span class="smcap">Bong</span>, as they threw themselves violently into two arm-chairs
(which almost broke under the brutal force of their descent), and
emptied two casks of whiskey.</p>

<p>As I looked at Sir <span class="smcap">Harry</span>, with his wide shoulders and deeper chest, I
could not help thinking what a curious contrast I was to him, with my
head of grizzled hair cut short and starting up like a half-worn
scrubbing-brush. Then there was <span class="smcap">Bong</span>, who is not like either of us,
being short, dark, stout,&mdash;<i>very</i> stout,&mdash;with twinkling black eyes
everlastingly hidden by blue spectacles.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 30%">
<a href="images/088d.png">
<img src="images/088d.png" width="100%" alt="Adam Slaughterman" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Look here, old fellow," said Sir <span class="smcap">Harry</span>, "why shouldn't we give up
civilisation, and go in for the mud&mdash;I mean blood&mdash;baths in South
Africa?"</p>

<p>I fairly jumped at his words.</p>

<p>"Nothing I should like better. And you, <span class="smcap">Bong</span>?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bong</span> is so overpoweringly frivolous.</p>

<p>"I'll go, because I am getting fat."</p>

<p>"Shut up, <span class="smcap">Bong</span>," said Sir <span class="smcap">Harry</span>, and then we screamed at the witticism
for three hours. After that we started for Africa, in search of the land
of the White-eyed Kaffirs, which we believed to be somewhere south of
the Westminster Aquarium, the Alhambra, and other Music-Halls in which a
specimen of the race had occasionally been seen.</p>

<p>On our arrival in Africa we found our old friend, <span class="smcap">Umbugsoapygas</span>, with
his huge battle-axe (playfully called Kosikutums or "the brain-pricker,"
from a habit he had of chipping life out of a man's cranium), awaiting
us. He was a huge savage, with a large piece of loose skin concealing
the right side of his face, which was absolutely boneless. <span class="smcap">Umbugsoapygas</span>
was delighted to see us.</p>

<p>"O cove, O cove-dat-am-cool!"&mdash;(Oh individual, oh individual without the
influence of passion!)&mdash;"brave one, great one! Let me come with thee to
swim in gore!"</p>

<p>I let him say this, as I saw his enthusiasm was producing a marked
effect upon the minds of some niggers that were listening to him. But
after he had said it, I thought it better to stop his vapouring;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
for there is nothing I hate so much, as this Zulu system of extravagant
praising&mdash;"zwaggering," as they call it.</p>

<p>"Shut up!" I cried, the more especially as I saw that he was getting the
blood-fever upon him, and savagely destroying with his huge axe a
spider's cobweb.</p>

<p>He gave me a sort of nod, and seized the niggers by their throats until
their eyes cracked. Then, with roars of laughter (for they really looked
most ridiculous), we followed the blacks into the boat, and went to the
Mission House of the Rev. <span class="smcap">Bang McSaxpence</span>, without any further adventure
than cutting off at the wrist the hand of one of the murderous tribe of
Lorkymussies.</p>

<center>CHAPTER II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mission Work in South Africa.</span></center>

<p>The Rev. <span class="smcap">Bang McSaxpence</span> and his wife and child lived in great comfort
amidst the people they had taught so carefully. I do not quite know what
the educational curriculum happened to be, but no doubt it would have
merited the approval of the London School Board. They had a French cook,
called <span class="smcap">Adolphe</span>, who seemingly had been obtained from a travelling Circus
that no doubt had passed the Mission House in the course of a provincial
tour.</p>

<p>"Oh, the monster! See the horrible man. He is a Mister Black," said
<span class="smcap">Adolphe</span>, looking at <span class="smcap">Umbugsoapygas</span>. The savage in a moment had dragged
out the little Frenchman's eyes, thrown them high in the air, rubbed
them in salt, and replaced them in their sockets. <span class="smcap">Bong</span>, Sir <span class="smcap">Harry</span>, and I
could not help laughing.</p>

<p>A little later we were called in by Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bang McSaxpence</span>, and soon were
enjoying a really good cup of tea. I was putting forth my hand for a
fresh supply, when the breakfast-things were knocked over by a head
freshly severed from the trunk.</p>

<p>"Rough and <i>reddy</i>!" I suggested, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Another carpet spoiled!" said gentle Mrs. <span class="smcap">McSaxpence</span>, trying to wipe
out the deep crimson stain.</p>

<p>"This is serious," observed the Rev. <span class="smcap">Bang McSaxpence</span> arming himself with
a carving-knife, "the Lorkymussies are upon us. And, to cause me greater
annoyance, they have kidnapped my daughter <span class="smcap">Tottie</span>."</p>

<p>This turned out to be the case, and although we could not help smiling
at the notion of a fair-haired little girl being at the mercy of some
clumsy, tomahawking, brutal cannibals, we felt very sorry for the
bereaved father.</p>

<p>We started. The first victim was a sentinel. <span class="smcap">Umbugsoapygas</span> clutched him
by the throat and pulling his head back, tore it off with a crack, like
the popping of a soda-water cork. Then we were upon them. There were
yells, crashes, and blood all over the place. The "Brain-pricker" was
here there and everywhere, scooping out brains just like a cheese-scoop
scoops out cheese to be tasted by the customers of a London butterman.
It really was all very amusing, and in spite of our servants being
absolutely cut to pieces, we were in the gayest spirits imaginable. That
all should end happily, who should turn up at the last moment but
<span class="smcap">Tottie</span>, with a little pail into which the dear child had poured the
heart's blood of some of her persecutors.</p>

<p>"I shot six of them with my own little revolver," said the interesting
infant, as I stroked her golden-hair with my crimson-coloured fingers;
"wasn't it clever of me?"</p>

<p>We had a very good lunch, the <i>poulet &agrave; la Portugaise</i> of <span class="smcap">Adolphe</span> being
particularly worthy of a second helping. After this meal was over, I
went to the Rev. <span class="smcap">Bang McSaxpence</span>, and taking him by the arm, observed,
"I really think you ought to give up this sort of life. You see you owe
a duty to your wife and daughter&mdash;especially the latter, who, if she
does not receive any education, and only mixes with bloodthirsty
cannibals, may grow up wild, shunning her kind."</p>

<p>"You are right, <span class="smcap">Slaughterman</span>," replied the Minister, straightening his
carving-knife, which since the night before had severed many a human
rib. "I made up my mind to it this very morning, just before I began my
hacking and slaying. I won't risk another fight, but leave it to a
younger Clergyman. And besides, between you and me, I am well off. It is
thirty thousand pounds I am worth to-day, and every farthing of it made
by honest trade, and savings in the bank at Zanzibar&mdash;for living costs
me here next to nothing."</p>

<p>"You are right."</p>

<p>"I am sure of it," answered the Clergyman. "I will turn my back upon
this place in a month. But it will be a wrench&mdash;it will be a wrench."

</p>

<center>CHAPTER III.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Water on the Brain.</span></center>

<p>We left the Rev. <span class="smcap">Bang McSaxpence</span> (whose successor, by the way, was
killed and eaten six weeks later), taking with us the little <span class="smcap">Adolphe</span> (a
most invaluable butt for our buffooneries), and voyaged into the
Unknown. We got into a boat, and throwing overboard some niggers to pick
up dead swans, they were immediately (much to our amusement) drowned.
This made us think, and we came to the conclusion that they must have
been carried to death by a current. In a moment our canoe began to fly
along as if seized with a mighty hand, and we were in a tunnel. The
water hurried us along, and we had scarcely time to notice that we were
passing now "Baker Street Station," now "Portland Road," now "King's
Cross," when we were close to a gigantic lily of fire that nearly
roasted us. We passed, got to some rocks, and were trying to get a cab,
or at least a fly, when we suddenly came across a number of spiders.
They were dreadful creatures. They foamed at the mouth, screamed at one
another, and devoured their invalid relations.</p>

<p>Here I should like to pause to write something <i>really</i> terrible about
these spiders, but must hurry on, as there is still a deal of killing to
be done before I get to the end of my narrative. Enough to say I may
return to those spiders some of these days, and out of their webs spin a
three-volume novel of unusual grimness and humour.</p>

<p>Shortly after this we emerged from the tunnel (passing by a place called
Gloucester Road), and found ourselves in the land of the White-eyed
Kaffirs.<sup><a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></sup>
</p>

<center>CHAPTER IV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Quite Killing.</span></center>

<p>The country we now occupied was called New Pendy&mdash;no doubt because it
had never been written about before. It is not very necessary to
describe the lands or the people; and really the most remarkable thing
in the place was a staircase, of a very wonderful character. Let the
reader imagine, if he can, a splendid stairway, sixty-five feet from
balustrade to balustrade, consisting of two vast flights, each of one
hundred and twenty-five steps, of eight inches in height, by three feet
broad, connected by a flat resting-place sixty feet in length, and
running from the palace wall, on the edge of the precipice down to meet
a waterway or canal cut to its foot from the river. This was the great
staircase, the magnificence of which fairly took our breath away.<sup><a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></sup>
</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 30%">
<a href="images/089.png">
<img src="images/089.png" width="100%" alt="wedding cake" /></a>
</div>

<p>Having described the staircase, it is only necessary to say that the New
Pendies were governed by two Queens, one of whom fell in love with Sir
<span class="smcap">Harry</span> and married him, quarrelled with her sister, and engaged in a
civil war which rent the country in twain. This naturally occasioned a
good deal of bloodshed. Never shall I forget the manner in which
<span class="smcap">Tryleapyea</span> (the lady who honoured Sir <span class="smcap">Harry</span> with her preference) wooed
that individual. When they first met they could not speak the same
language, so she took a pencil from me and made a delightful little
sketch, which I give in the margin. There is no difficulty in
recognising a bride expressing admiration at a wedding-cake.</p>

<p>Need I say that after her marriage <span class="smcap">Tryleapyea's</span> subjects had the most
terrible fight with the subjects of her sister <span class="smcap">Saramariah</span>, which was
chiefly waged on the staircase. This happened after I and <span class="smcap">Umbugsoapygas</span>
had performed together a kind of "Turpin's Ride to York," from the
battlefield. <span class="smcap">Adolphe</span> escaped to post these memoirs&mdash;<span class="smcap">Umbugsoapygas</span> was
cut to pieces. Sir <span class="smcap">Henry</span> and <span class="smcap">Bong</span> in his blue spectacles, were kept for
ever in the New Pendy country, and, finally, I myself was killed,
funeralled, and cremated.<sup><a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></sup>

in their official capacity, get the customary guineas, and enjoy the
lunch provided as usual for their refreshment in the discharge of their
arduous duties? If so, of course, it can't be said that a balloon was a
place where those Guinea-Pigs had no business. The Balloon also
contained two Pigeons; but these perhaps were birds of a different

<p><i>Sm-th.</i> Nip of Irish, B.?</p>

<p><i>B-lf-r.</i> Irish be&mdash;<i>proclaimed</i>! Sick of the very name of Irish. <i>Do</i>
let's forget it for awhile, and hand me the J. J., there's a good
fellow.</p>

<p><i>S-l-sb-ry (musing).</i> Humph! Pretty pair of Sportsmen! Empty rotundity,
and linked languor long drawn out. Wonder what <span class="smcap">Dizzy</span> would have thought
of such a pair of guns, especially of "his successor." <i>Tracy Tupman</i>

<p><i>B-lf-r (disgustedly).</i> Oh, <span class="smcap">M-tth-ws</span>! Missed every bird he's tried at.
Pity all burglars are not as bad shots as he. Couldn't hit a constable
at ten yards.</p>

<p><i>S-l-sb-ry (drily).</i> Not if he <i>tried</i>. I never feel safe at twenty. If

his friends with him.</p>

<p><i>B-lf-r.</i> Well, perhaps they'll join us later on.</p>

<p><i>S-l-sb-ry (aside).</i> I <i>hope</i> so. Not much prospect of a decent bag if
they don't, I fear. Fact is, my party this year's a failure. Scarcely a
good gun among them. Finest and largest shooting-ground we've had for
years, and <i>yet</i> we can't make a bag. Adjoining Moor supposed to be an
absolute failure, and yet the party who've taken it&mdash;on most Liberal
terms I hear, and with little hope of good sport&mdash;are picking up birds
like fun. Pop, pop, pop, pop! and every bang a bird. Old G. getting
quite cock-a-whoop about it. Fancies he'll top us at the end of the
shoot. Quite wrong, of course. Now that, at last, we've really dropped
upon that rascally gang of Irish poachers who had leagued themselves
together to play the mischief with our Moor, I guess we shall astonish
G.'s party a trifle. <i>They</i> wink at the poaching Paddies. Most
unsportsmanlike conduct I ever heard of. What'll they do, <i>now</i>, I
wonder? Still we can't afford to go on muffing and missing <i>too</i> long.
Bang! There goes another. And one of our birds, too, I'll be bound.
Hillo! by Jove, there's <span class="smcap">H-rt-ngt-n</span>, sauntering this way, and by himself,
too. Something like a shot, <i>he</i> is, and, if he'd join us&mdash;well, well,
we shall see. Looks, as usual, as though he didn't care a single tomtit
for things in general, and shooting in particular. Often lets a bird go

he can't be comfortable with <i>that</i> lot&mdash;indeed, he owns it. And they
don't like his friendliness with us. Why can't he join us, and have done
with it?</p>

<p><i>H-rt-ngt-n (approaching).</i> Ah! there they are. And a jolly lot of
Sportsmen they look. Poor <span class="smcap">S-l-sb-ry</span>, I pity him. Ought to have swept the
Moors. Birds plentiful, and lots of guns. But no shots. Doosed awkward.
Know what it is to shoot with a party one doesn't get on with. Our party
not the right sort now; awfully mixed&mdash;doesn't suit me a bit. G. has let
in too many outsiders. If they'd rally round me now, and let me pick
'em! But the picked rallyers are so precious few, and the rest, instead
of closing up to me, seem to be tailing off after <span class="smcap">Gl-dst-ne</span>, somehow,
confound 'em! One <i>Ch-mb-rl-n</i> doesn't make a shooting party, even
with <span class="smcap">Br-ght</span> thrown in. Don't want to shoot against <span class="smcap">S-l-sb-ry</span>, though,
I'm sure. Much rather drive the birds his way. But join him!&mdash;humph!</p>

<p><i>S-l-sb-ry (hailing).</i> Hillo, <span class="smcap">H-rt-ngt-n</span>, old man, how are you? All
alone? Where's your party?</p>

<p><i>H-rt-ngt-n.</i> Oh! they're along behind there, somewhere. How are <i>you</i>
getting on?</p>

<p><i>S-l-sb-ry.</i> Oh, pre-e-t-ty well&mdash;considering. Hardly got our hands in
yet,&mdash;some of us (<i>significantly</i>). Birds a bit shy, too. But we shall
get among them presently, and then!&mdash;(<i>sotto voce</i>). I say old
fellow, why don't you join us&mdash;after lunch? <i>Capital</i> shooting-ground,
but, ahem!&mdash;some of our fellows a <i>leetle</i> wild, and one or two regular
cockneys. I wan't a real good gun or two badly, and then we should be
safe for a splendid bag. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Come, old fellow, what do you say?</p>

<p><i>H-rt-ngt-n.</i> Tha-a-nks. Awfully kind, I'm sure. But&mdash;ah&mdash;fact is, I'm
just waiting to see if my Party's coming up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [<i>Left waiting.</i></p>

<h2>THE ARTIST'S HOLIDAY;</h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">Or, a Brush With the Police.</span></h4>

<p><i>Start for Isle of Wight.</i>&mdash;Market for Pictures so depressed, can only
afford a fortnight away from Town this Summer. Never mind! Intend to
have a high old time while it lasts. Shall travel over the whole
Island&mdash;Cowes, Ryde, Ventnor, Shanklin, Alum Bay, and the Needles.
Travelling suggests that I'm my own "traveller"&mdash;in the Oil and Colour
line! Mustn't mention this joke to my aristocratic customers, however.</p>

<p><i>On the Way Down.</i>&mdash;Read in my favourite newspaper&mdash;"Art is a fanciful
and captious mistress, exacting many sacrifices from her servants, and
not infrequently putting them to considerable inconvenience." Sounds
unpleasant. Wish people wouldn't write like this. True, perhaps, but not
edifying. Writer goes on to say of Artists that "Respectability is
arrayed in arms against them, because their ways are not as those of its
smug and unimaginative votaries." (Rather a good hit that&mdash;"smug and
unimaginative;"&mdash;writer not such a fool as I thought.) "Mrs. <span class="smcap">Grundy</span>
sniffs at them with righteous scorn, because their appearance, bearing,
and habits, are not measurable by the standards of propriety." (I should
hope not, indeed!) "The subaltern administrators of the law regard them
with suspicion"&mdash;Humbug! Throw paper down in disgust. Never been
interfered with by a policeman in my life. What is there in <i>me</i> to
excite suspicion, I should like to know? Should write to Author of that
article, and tell him he's an ass, only can't afford to waste a stamp
just now.</p>

<p><i>Southampton.</i>&mdash;Go on board boat for Ryde. Curious. Three men following
me about everywhere! On stepping on to Ryde pier, they make a pounce on
me. Ask to see my luggage. It seems they are "subaltern administrators
of the law," disguised. I refuse to give up my keys; in order to mollify
them, make a joke, and tell them "they can't Ryde the high horse here."
Only reply they make is to break my bag open. Very objectionable. Crowd
evidently think I'm a London thief, and hoot at me.</p>

<p>Ask Detectives if they think I look like a Dynamiter? They say nothing,
and wink. Seem to look on my question as a "leading," or rather a
misleading, one. Thank Heaven! There's nothing suspicious in my
Gladstone bag. But, as these are Government emissaries, perhaps the mere
possession of a "Gladstone" bag is considered to connect me in some
mysterious way with Parnellism, and so with crime. Is there such a thing
as a "Salisbury" bag? Wish I'd got one if there is. Perhaps it would be
a good move to tell them I'm a Unionist. They reply (gruffly) "they
don't want none of my gab," and that <i>they</i> intend to find out what I am
precious quick.</p>

<p><i>At Police Station.</i>&mdash;(To which I've been taken, through a howling mob!)
Bag opened. Several things appear to excite suspicion. Palette inspected
carefully. If it hadn't been for bad success of my last humorous remark,
should tell my captors that "I've no <i>palate</i> for conspiracy." My box of
brushes regarded as highly questionable. Suggests obvious
sporting-riddle&mdash;Why do they think I've been in at the death (of
somebody or other?)&mdash;Answer: <i>because I've got the brush!</i> Bottle of
Chinese White at once impounded. Considered to contain "an explosive
composition," it seems. Detectives convey it carefully to middle of
large field, and bury it, until Colonel <span class="smcap">Majendie</span> can come down from
Town. What, however, is regarded as greatest proof of my nefarious
tendencies is a picture of London Bridge in my portfolio. Detective asks
triumphantly&mdash;"What made you draw that there bridge if you ain't a
Fenian, now?" I reply "it's only a pot-boiler." Answer considered so
very incriminating that I am immediately handcuffed and put in a cell.
Never realised before what a very "fanciful and captious mistress," Art
is, or what idiots "the subaltern administrators of the law" are capable
of making of themselves.</p>

<p><i>Three Days Later.</i>&mdash;Liberated! Am told it was "all a mistake." Chinese
White bottle proved not to contain anything dangerous to human life.
Pot-boiler restored me, slightly soiled. No excuses or apologies
made&mdash;sent away with a "free pardon!" And this is England! Ah, they
manage some things better in France!</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<center>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</center>

<p><i>House of Lords, Monday, August 15.</i>&mdash;Some ordinary business on Agenda,
but importance dwarfed by imposing demonstration made by <span class="smcap">Wemyss</span>. Session
really coming to a close. <span class="smcap">Wemyss</span> has done his share of speech-making.
According to <span class="smcap">Denman</span> has appropriated more than fair share. Nevertheless,
he finds in Mid-August quite an accumulation of odds and ends omitted
from speeches prepared during last two years. If he doesn't work them
off this Session will be out of date by next. That no insuperable
objection to delivering speech in House of Lords; still, freshness and
appropriateness not altogether without weight. How shall he dispose of
the accumulated treasure? Thought once of publishing it in single
Volume, call it "Jubilee Thoughts, by Earl of <span class="smcap">Wemyss</span>;" or "Peerless Wit
and Wisdom, by a Peer." Found publishers not anxious to undertake
proposal. Jubilee, they said, beginning to pall, too many books about of
Wit and Wisdom. Happy thought! Why not throw the scraps into form of
speech, and favour House of Lords with it? Some of the topics little
ancient and continuity of thought difficult to simulate; but propose to
"call attention to Socialistic legislation during the Sessions of 1886
and 1887." That will cover everything.</p>

<p>So arranged, and to-night, as soon as immaterial business disposed of,
<span class="smcap">Wemyss</span> rose, and began his speech. Audience of eighteen, to begin with.
Gradually diminished, till there remained, for fifth and final
peroration, only four. Was a tremendous speech&mdash;bloodcurdling,
convincing, and delivered with much animation. Never was a nation in
such peril. Before Great Britain lay only Black Night and Despair.</p>

<p>Might have been expected that, when <span class="smcap">Wemyss</span> sat down, there would have
been eager competition for precedence to take up the thread of debate so
solemnly launched. But he'd overdone it. So terrified the few Peers
present, that none could speak. Looked at each other with fitful,
fearful glances. One by one they rose, and tremblingly tottered out.
<span class="smcap">Wemyss</span> left in solitary possession of House, filled only with echoes of
his fearsome jeremiad. Thus closed this memorable one-speech debate.
<span class="smcap">Lord Chancellor</span> retaining presence of mind sufficient to adjourn the
House, <span class="smcap">Wemyss</span> picked up his notes, and went forth, probably to prepare
for his own flight from the doomed country.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;In Commons, Mines Bill in Committee.</p>

<p><i>House of Commons, Tuesday.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">John Manners</span> in his place to-night.
Everyone glad to see him back again; Liberals, Conservatives,
Dissentients, Unionists, whatever we be, all unite in saying a friendly
word to <span class="smcap">John</span> on his convalescence.</p>

<p>Another arrival greeted with more mixed feelings. <span class="smcap">Brunner</span>, flushed by
his great victory in Northwich, comes up to be sworn in. Tremendous
cheering on Liberal side. Dead silence among Ministerialists. Old
Morality gazes up at glass roof with preoccupied air; thoughts far away
from Westminster or Northwich either. <span class="smcap">Caine</span>, looking on from Bar, turns
his back, and marches forth.</p>

<p>"Another blessing in disguise," says he. "I think now I'll go off to
Japan, and see how they're getting on with their projected Parliamentary
Institutions. Might get some hints for forming our National Party."</p>

<h4>T. B-rt.</h4>
</div>

<p>Crimes Bill on again. Committee pegging away far into tomorrow. A good
business-like debate, but a little dull. Minority of between seventy and
eighty industriously tried to carry Amendments moved by <span class="smcap">Burt</span> and others.
Majority, varying between 120 and 140, thinking matter over in privacy
of smoke-room, news-room, and terrace, come up with minds fully made up
on points of detail, and always vote with Ministers. <span class="smcap">Burt</span>, beaten again
and again, comes back to scratch, looking, towards half-past two in the
morning, a little broken down, but still full of fight.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Mines Bill.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;House of Lords deserves well of its country. Is setting
Commons example it will do well to follow. On Monday, as noted, <span class="smcap">Wemyss</span>
made long speech, and, no one rising to follow in debate, House
forthwith adjourned. Same thing happened on Tuesday when <span class="smcap">Denman</span>
introduced beneficent proposals for limiting speeches. Met with success
beyond his wildest expectations. Had asked that duration of speeches
might be strictly limited. Lords with one accord forthwith accepted
principle. Applied it so strictly that, as <span class="smcap">Lord Chancellor</span> in his
epigrammatic way put it, "speeches were limited to silence." In fact no
one spoke at all. <span class="smcap">Denman</span> had debate all to himself, and House adjourned.
So pleased with this arrangement that it was carried a step further
to-night. Only one speech was made. Was delivered from Woolsack. So
brief may be quoted <i>verbatim</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>"House will now adjourn," said <span class="smcap">Lord Chancellor</span>.</p>

<p>That was all, and noble Lords dispersed.</p>

<p>"Most pleasant, informing and useful sitting we've had for many
Sessions," said <span class="smcap">Buckingham</span> to <span class="smcap">Chandos</span>.</p>

<p>"<i>Allons!</i>" said <span class="smcap">Stratheden</span> to <span class="smcap">Campbell</span>, "let us go and visit those
foolish Commons who waste their time in much speaking."</p>

<p>Commons crowded and animated. Evidently no prospect here of foregoing
speech-making. Sixty-eight questions on paper to begin with. <span class="smcap">George
Campbell</span>, his mind athirst for information, wanted to know from
President of Board of Trade what was the meaning of "allotment."
<span class="smcap">Ritchie</span>, with elbow leaning negligently on box, and legs crossed,
mockingly referred the ingenuous Knight to <i>Johnson's Dictionary</i>.
Curiously reminiscent of <i>Mephistopheles</i> bantering <i>Faust</i>, was <span class="smcap">Ritchie</span>
as he looked across at <span class="smcap">Campbell</span>.</p>

<p>Old Morality announced abandonment of various Government measures,
dropping tear over each. Emotion became monotonous towards tenth tear,
and Opposition rudely laughed. But Old Morality had his revenge later.
Quite a long time since he has "pounced." But as midnight drew on, and
little progress made, began to grow desperate. <span class="smcap">Chamberlain</span> suddenly
turned upon his allies, attacked them in rattling speech. Even voted
against them when Division called. Government majority went down from
customary hundred to alarming forty-two. Then Old Morality, goaded to
madness, "pounced" right and left. <span class="smcap">Harcourt</span> stirred up <span class="smcap">Goschen</span> with long
pole; <span class="smcap">Balfour</span> yawned ostentatiously when <span class="smcap">Dillon</span> convicted him of
ignorance of Irish affairs; <span class="smcap">Parnell</span> pounded away; <span class="smcap">T. W. Russell</span> withdrew
from alliance with Government; <span class="smcap">Tim Healy</span> chuckled; <span class="smcap">Joseph Gillis</span>
alternately jeered and groaned. But Old Morality came out victor.
Whenever lull occurred he moved Closure, and so presently wound up
sitting.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Split between "Dissentient Liberals" and Government.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;House not so full to-night. Rumour about that there was
something to fore in Lords. Members migrated thither. Only a few Peers
present. Markiss rose, and in matter-of-fact tone, as if offering
observation on state of weather, announced Proclamation of National
League. Fifteen Peers present successfully controlled emotion, and
passed on to ordinary business. Commons, penned in Gallery above, and
crowded at Bar below, rushed to own House,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span> carrying news with them.
Arrived just in time to hear <span class="smcap">Hanbury</span> question Government on quite other
subject. <span class="smcap">Hanbury's</span> hawk eye had discovered in the Estimates vote for
salary of Master of Hawks. Wanted to know who he was, what he did for a
living, and how many hawks he might have to deal with in course of year.
Frank and somewhat startling disclosure from Treasury Bench. The
existence of Master of Hawks admitted; regular payment of his salary
confessed. Only hitch was that there were no hawks. Still, there have
been hawks in time of <span class="smcap">Stuarts</span>. An impecunious nobleman had obtained
office, with reversion to eldest son; and so, through the ages,
unsuspecting taxpayer had subscribed salary. House so ashamed to
discover its remissness as custodian of Public purse, that, by common
consent, subject dropped. But silent resolution taken that noble
Hawk-master shall have drawn his salary for last time.</p>

<p>Then <span class="smcap">Balfour</span> confirmed statement made in other House about Proclamation
of National League. Announcement received, on the whole, in grim
silence, also not without its portent. House then took up Allotments
Bill, with which it wrestled in business fashion for rest of sitting.</p>

<p class="i0">Muck even the great <span class="smcap">Arthur Shrewsbury's</span> play, and make <span class="smcap">Walter Read's</span> chance of top-average dicky,</p>
<p class="i0"><span class="smcap">Arthur's</span> two centuries <i>plus</i> sixty-seven, falls off to a pitiful seven-and-twenty,</p>
<p class="i0">And <span class="smcap">Barlow</span> and <span class="smcap">Briggs</span> have it all their own way; three "ducks" in one innings&mdash;of Notts men&mdash;seems plenty.</p>
<p class="i0">Look at poor Yorkshire again! <span class="smcap">Martin Hawke</span> did his best to choose right, but caked wickets <i>plus</i> <span class="smcap">Lohmann</span>,</p>
<p class="i0">Are far too long odds e'en for <span class="smcap">Ulyett</span> and <span class="smcap">Hall</span>; and who can foresee English weather? Why, no man.</p>
<p class="i0">Wants a cool sticker like <span class="smcap">Scotton</span> to stand it. Eh? Gives the poor bowlers a look in? Oh, granted,</p>
<p class="i0">Good trundling's a part of the game to be sure, but you see at this crisis it's <i>scoring</i> that's wanted,</p>
<p class="i0">Dashes the 'gazers, this downing the wickets like nine-pins in swamp with muck-moisture afloat all,</p>
<p class="i0">And then ninety-two for a tall-scoring team like our Notts, you must own's a contemptible total,</p>
<p class="i0">Middlesex plays in and out; lots of scorers like <span class="smcap">Webbe</span>, <span class="smcap">Stoddart</span>, <span class="smcap">Lucas</span>, <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span>, and <span class="smcap">Vernon</span>.</p>
<p class="i0">But <span class="smcap">Robertson</span>, <span class="smcap">Burton</span>, and <span class="smcap">West</span> want assistance as bowlers, and bowling's a thing wins will turn on.</p>
<p class="i0">Gloucester's slap out of it. Pity poor <span class="smcap">Grace</span> with a team he can seldom bring up to the scratch, Sir,</p>
<p class="i0">So that, in spite of his own startling scores, the, at one time, "Invincibles" scarce win a match, Sir,</p>
<p class="i0">Sussex,&mdash;well, <span class="smcap">Quaife</span> is a promising bat, and you always may look for some notches from <span class="smcap">Newham</span>,</p>
<p class="i0">Whilst J. and A. <span class="smcap">Hide</span> are a host in themselves; but good fortune this season has failed to pursue 'em.</p>
<p class="i0">Kent, with Lord <span class="smcap">Harris</span>, the family of <span class="smcap">Hearnes</span>, and <span class="smcap">Rashleigh</span>, with credit should carry field matters on,</p>
<p class="i0">But this year they'll not be at top of the tree, 'spite the bowling of <span class="smcap">Wooton</span>, the smiting of <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>.</p>
<p class="i0">Leicester has got a good trundler in <span class="smcap">Pougher</span>, but one bowler won't make a good (Cricket) summer,</p>
<p class="i0">Whilst Derbyshire's <span class="smcap">Chatterton</span>, <span class="smcap">Cropper</span>, and <span class="smcap">Ratcliff</span> don't make her, at present, the new (Cricket) comer.</p>
<p class="i0">As for game Essex,&mdash;well, evergreen <span class="smcap">Green</span>, who has done in his day some redoubtable cricket,</p>
<p class="i0">Will own he will not have a look in <i>this</i> year, e'en with <span class="smcap">Buxton</span>, and <span class="smcap">Bishop</span>, and <span class="smcap">Bryan</span>, and <span class="smcap">Pickett</span>.</p>
<p class="i0">No, we must still look to one of the four; and oh, what a lot hope that one will be Surrey,</p>
<p class="i0">Fancy the spirits of <span class="smcap">Griffith</span> and <span class="smcap">Southerton</span>&mdash;(chums of that "barn-door" whom no one could flurry,</p>
<p class="i0">Stout little <span class="smcap">Jupp</span>)&mdash;must just now haunt the Oval, or hold ghostly confabulations at Mitcham,</p>
<p class="i0">Discussing the way in which <span class="smcap">Shuter's</span> lot cut 'em and drive 'em, and swipe 'em, and place 'em, and pitch 'em.</p>
<p class="i0">And oh! <i>if</i> smart <span class="smcap">Shuter</span>, crack <span class="smcap">Read</span>, steady <span class="smcap">Lohmann</span>, and swift-footed <span class="smcap">Maurice</span>, and cat-like young <span class="smcap">Abel</span></p>
<p class="i0"><i>Should</i> once more put Surrey at top of the tree, won't the Oval just be a tumultuous Babel?</p>
